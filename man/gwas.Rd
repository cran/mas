\details{

The function \code{gwas} is a wrapper for \code{GWAS} that accepts vectors as inputs, suitable for single-trait analysis and discrete membership, such as family, ethnicity or population.

The linear model for the genome-wide association is set as follows:

\deqn{ y = Xb + Zu + g + e }

where \eqn{y} is the response variable, \eqn{Xb} corresponds to the fixed effect term set as the membership matrix, \eqn{Zu} corresponds to the marker-membership interaction term, \eqn{g} is the polygenic term defines by \eqn{g=Ma}, where \eqn{M} is the genotypic matrix and \eqn{g} are marker effects, and \eqn{e} is the residual term. The null-hypothesis term cosists of a similar model, but without \eqn{Zu}. The significance threshold is based on the Bonferroni correction.

Theorical description of the model is provided by Wei and Xu (2016). Variance components are REML estimates under the univariate case. In the multivariate case, variance and covariance components are obtained through a general-purpose REML approximation (Van Raden and Jung 1987), which yields the exact same solution as REML when all traits are observed in all individuals. The multivariate generalization is described by Xavier and Habier (2022).

The package provides the function \code{MLM(Y,X,Z)} for users only interested in solving multivariate mixed models, which takes as input the phenotypic matrix (\code{Y}), design matrices of fixed effects (\code{X}) and random effect (\code{Z}), and the same controls (\code{logtol,cores}) as the function \code{GWAS}. This function uses an efficient solver without single-value decomposition, as described by Xavier and Habier (2022). 

In the \code{GWAS} function, set \code{M=matrix(rep(1,nrow(Y)))} when membership is not knwon.

The output of functions \code{gwas/GWAS} is of class "GenModel", which has two custom functions: \code{plot} and \code{print}. The function \code{plot.GenModel} has a few arguments that allow users to choose the trait (\code{trait=1}), to overlay plots (\code{add=FALSE}), and to plot the QTL heritability instead of the association statistic (\code{h2=FALSE}).

\value{
  
Returns a list of class "GenModel" with two sublists: POLY and GWAS. The POLY list contains fixed and random effect coefficients, variance components, genetic correlations, heritability. The GWAS list provides the Wald statistics and QTL variances for each marker-trait combination, as well as the regression coefficients for each marker-population combination for the last trait.
